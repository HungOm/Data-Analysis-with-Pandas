# Data-Analysis-with-Pandas
My second project in python 3 using IPython. IPython is just like the normal shell you get when you run python, but it provides better printing of large output. This make IPython suitable for data anlysis as it prints data in a well structured format. IPython can be installed with pip: pip install ipython  or pip3 install ipython or python3 -m pip install ipython
